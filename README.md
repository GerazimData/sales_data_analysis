# Welcome to sales_data_analysis

In this project i use Python to prepare, transfrom, analyze and visualize sales data to extract insights from it by answering the following questions on the data:
1. What months has the highest sales?
2. Which city has the highest orders?
3. What time of the day are most sales happening?
4. What products are sold the most and what are the possible reasons?
5. What products are mainly sold together?

By focusing on the answers to this questions the company can use this insight to reshape their marketing strategies, improve pricing and make solid recommendations of products to customers and a result the company would enjoy an increase in revenue.

Hope you enjoy!
